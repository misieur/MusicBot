This bot can play music in voice channels from Spotify, Deezer, and YouTube. The bot will take a Spotify, Deezer, or YouTube link, find its title and artist, and search for it on YouTube (if the link is not already a YouTube link). It will then download the audio from YouTube, not from Deezer or Spotify, for several reasons. First, I don't know how to download from those platforms, and secondly, it's simply forbidden. I don't want to get banned from Spotify or Deezer, although I don't really care, but I still won't do it because it's also illegal.

This bot uses the yt_dlp API with OAuth2 to bypass bot detection. It also uses the Spotify API, which requires a token, and the Google API for searching. However, the Google API can be replaced with youtube-search.
